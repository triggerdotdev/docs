## Automatic setups

If you don't already have a long-running Node.js server, you can use [our CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-trigger) to get a new project up and running in just a few seconds:

```bash
npx create-trigger@latest
```

You'll be asked to choose from one of our [Templates](https://app.trigger.dev/templates), and if this is your first time we suggest trying the [Hello World](https://app.trigger.dev/templates/hello-world) template:

## Manual setup

You can easily add Trigger.dev to your existing project. This guide will walk you through the steps to get your first workflow running.

<Note>
  We don't currently support projects that deploy to serverless platforms, such
  as Next.js and Vercel or AWS Lambda. You must have a long-running Node.js
  process to use us in production, such as an express server running on Heroku,
  Render.com, or Fly.io. If you aren't sure if it's possible to use Trigger.dev,
  please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/nkqV9xBYWy) or
  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/triggerdotdev).
</Note>

### Installing @trigger.dev packages

In your existing project install the packages:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">

```bash
npm install @trigger.dev/sdk zod
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm add @trigger.dev/sdk zod
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @trigger.dev/sdk zod
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

What do the packages do?

- `@trigger.dev/sdk` is required to use Trigger.dev, it allows you to define and run workflows.
- `zod` is used to define schemas. See our [zod guide](/guides/zod) for more details.

### Get your development API key

Go to [trigger.dev](https://app.trigger.dev) and sign up or login to your account.

In the bottom-left corner of an Organization page you can find your API keys.
![API Keys](https://imagedelivery.net/3TbraffuDZ4aEf8KWOmI_w/d8ce1286-153c-4a94-8e1a-df7ac2a4fb00/public)

### Creating your first workflow

Workflows are triggered by events. In this example, we have defined a [custom event](/triggers/custom-events) called `user.created`. We support many different types of events including [webhooks](/triggers/webhooks), [scheduled](/triggers/scheduled), and more coming soon.

```ts src/triggers.ts
import { Trigger, customEvent } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { z } from "zod";

new Trigger({
  // Give your Trigger a stable ID
  id: "new-user",
  name: "New user",
  // For security, we recommend moving this api key to your .env / secrets file.
  // Our env variable is called TRIGGER_API_KEY
  apiKey: "<your_api_key>",
  // Trigger on a custom event, see https://docs.trigger.dev/triggers/custom-events
  on: customEvent({
    name: "user.created",
    // Use zod to verify event payload. See https://docs.trigger.dev/guides/zod
    schema: z.object({
      id: z.string(),
    }),
  }),
  // The run functions gets called once per "user.created" event
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    // Event is the payload of the event, e.g. { id: "user_1234" }
    await ctx.logger.info("A new user has been created!", { event });
  },
}).listen(); // Calling listen() will connect to Trigger.dev and start listening for events
```

<Warning>
  Above we set the API key inside the Trigger object. We recommend instead that
  you add an environment variable called `TRIGGER_API_KEY`. That way you can use
  your development API key locally and the production one when you deploy.
</Warning>

Make sure you import your trigger file in your server code, e.g. `src/index.ts`:

```ts src/index.ts
import "./triggers";
```

### Start your Node.js process

Now that you have your workflow defined, you can start your Node.js process, usually this is done by running `npm run dev` or `npm start`, depending on your project.

Once you run your process, you should see a message in your console that looks like this:

```
[trigger.dev]  âœ¨ Connected and listening for events [new-user]
```

### Trigger the workflow

You can use the `@trigger.dev/sdk` to send custom events which will trigger your workflow. In this example we are using the `sendEvent` function to send a `user.created` event:

```ts
import { sendEvent } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { randomUUID } from "node:crypto";

// The first param should be a unique ID for this event
// You'll also need to set your development API key in the TRIGGER_API_KEY environment variable
await sendEvent(randomUUID(), {
  name: "user.created",
  payload: { id: "user_1234" },
});
```

To learn more about sending events, including using our [API](/api-reference/events/sendEvent), see the [Sending events](/functions/send-event) guide.
