## What is it?

It allows you to easily add Integrations for your users, such as:

- Add contacts to their Hubspot.
- Sync data to their Airtable.
- Post videos to their YouTube.
- Add issues to their Linear.

## How does it work?

1. Create an [Integration in the Dashboard](/documentation/guides/integrations).
2. Use our provided React components in your web app to authenticate your users.
3. Trigger a Job as one of your users.
4. Inside the Run function the relevant Integrations will be authenticated with your user's credentials.
5. Profit.
