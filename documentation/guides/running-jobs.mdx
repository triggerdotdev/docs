There are two ways to run your Jobs:

1. Triggering a test Run
2. Triggering your Job for real

## 1. Triggering a test Run

You can perform a Run with any payload you want or use one of our examples on the test page in our dashboard.

[How to do a test Run from the dashboard](/documentation/guides/testing-jobs).

## 2. Triggering your Job for real

Triggering your Job for real depends on the [type of trigger](/documentation/concepts/triggers) you have attached to your Job.

There are three types of Trigger:

### Scheduled Trigger

<Snippet file="scheduled-dev-warning.mdx" />

[Scheduled Triggers](/documentation/concepts/triggers/scheduled) are triggered automatically by our system on the schedule you define. Once you have [deployed](/documentation/guides/deployment) your Job, it will run automatically.

### Event Trigger

[Event Triggers](/documentation/concepts/triggers/event) are triggered by an event that you send from elsewhere in your code.

<Snippet file="send-event-options.mdx" />

### Webhook Trigger

[Webhook Triggers](/documentation/concepts/triggers/webhook) are triggered when you perform the action that the webhook subscribes to. For example, if you have a webhook Trigger that subscribes to the `pull_request` event on GitHub, then it will be triggered whenever a pull request is opened, closed, or updated on the repo you configured.
