[Jobs](/documentation/concepts/jobs) live inside a [Project](/documentation/concepts/projects).

For Jobs to actually run, they need to be connected to the Trigger.dev platform.

## Viewing Jobs

The main page for a Project is the list of connected Jobs. You can see overview details for a each Job here, including details on the Trigger, Integrations and when it was last run.

## How to add your first Job

We recommend you do the initial setup of a new Project by following our [quick start guide](/documentation/quickstart). Once completed you should have an example Job in your dashboard.

## Adding more Jobs locally

When you add a new Job to your codebase, you'll need to connect it to Trigger.dev. This is achieved by refreshing the endpoint in your local Dev environment.

1. Go to the "Environments & API Keys" page for your Project
   ![Click "Environments & API Keys"](/images/environments-link.png)
2. Select the "DEV" row in the table of endpoints.
   ![Environments & API Keys](/images/environments-click-dev.png)
3. Click the "Refresh now" button
   ![Refresh the DEV endpoint](/images/endpoint-refresh.png)

<Note>
  You only need to do this when you add a new Job (a job with an ID that hasn't
  been connected to Trigger.dev before). If you modify an existing Job, you
  don't need to refresh the endpoint.
</Note>

## Deploying Jobs

See our [deployment guide](/documentation/guides/deployment).

## Disabling Jobs

Sometimes there's a Job that you no longer want to be Triggered. You can achieve this by Disabling it. This will prevent the `run()` function being called for that Job.

## Archiving Jobs

<Note>Being able to archive Jobs is coming soon</Note>
