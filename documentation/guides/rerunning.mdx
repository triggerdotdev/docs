On the Run page when the Run is in a `success` or `failed` state, you can rerun by clicking the `Rerun` button.

![The Rerun button](/images/rerun.png)

There are two possible rerun options.

### 1. Run again

This option is always available (when a run has finished).

It creates a brand new run with the same inputs as the original â€“ the same Trigger payload, settings, connections etc.

<Warning>Stating the obvious: this will run all the code again.</Warning>

### 2. Retry job run

This option is only available when the run has failed.

It will continue the existing Run by retrying the Task that failed the Job.
